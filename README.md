# Arduino-Blinds
Adding to the school sensor;
we plan on adding a light sensor to detect the light shining in to the classroom so that the blinds may go up or down automatically without students having to ask the teacher to put them down everytime. It would save class time and save the teacher from getting off topic or forgeting what he or she was talking about after putting the blinds down.
