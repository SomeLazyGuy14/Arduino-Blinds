# Arduino-Blinds
  Adding to the school sensor

For the blinds to lower:

If statement checking whether or not the blinds have not already been lowered. If they are already down, nothing will happen.
If the blinds are not down, the blinds will be lowered at X meters per second (X to be defined).
When the blinds reach their lowest point, they will stop (X = 0)
